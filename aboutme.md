I am a postdoc and climate modeller at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), working on mechanisms of climate variability and reasons for systematic errors in climate models. I participated in leg 1 of the year-long MOSAiC drift expedition to the central Arctic Ocean and am developer of AWI's climate model AWI-CM-1-1, which provides results to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and informs the latest IPCC report.

My scientific goal is to add previously missing features and processes (for example: mesoscale ocean eddies, stochasticity in air-sea fluxes, leads in sea ice, or the drift and melt of icebergs) to current climate and weather simulations. These additions will improve the predictions made by our models. 

I am very interested in art and science communication and always looking for new creative ways to visualise climate change and its impacts for the public.
